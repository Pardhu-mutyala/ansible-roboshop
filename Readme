# Ansible Roboshop

This repository contains Ansible playbooks and supporting files to deploy the Roboshop microservices stack. The playbooks and service unit files are located under the `Ansible-rboshop/` directory.

## Repository layout (Ansible-rboshop/)
- inventory.ini
  - Example inventory used to target hosts/groups for deployment.
- mongo.repo
  - Repository configuration file for installing MongoDB on target hosts.
- cart.yaml
  - Playbook to install and configure the Cart service.
- catalogue.yaml
  - Playbook to install and configure the Catalogue service.
- user.yaml
  - Playbook to install and configure the User service.
- frontend.yaml
  - Playbook to install and configure the Frontend.
- mongodb.yaml
  - Playbook to install and configure MongoDB.
- redis.yaml
  - Playbook to install and configure Redis.
- cart.service, catalogue.service, user.service
  - systemd service unit files for the Cart, Catalogue, and User services respectively.

## Prerequisites
- Ansible installed on the control machine (recommended: 2.9+).
- SSH access from the control machine to target hosts with sudo privileges.
- Ensure target hosts have network access to required package repositories (or provide repository files like `mongo.repo` for MongoDB).

## How to use
1. Update inventory
   - Edit `Ansible-rboshop/inventory.ini` to include your target hosts and groups.

2. Run a playbook
   - From repository root, run:
     - Install and configure a microservice (example: Catalogue):
       - ansible-playbook -i Ansible-rboshop/inventory.ini Ansible-rboshop/catalogue.yaml
     - Install MongoDB:
       - ansible-playbook -i Ansible-rboshop/inventory.ini Ansible-rboshop/mongodb.yaml
     - Install Redis:
       - ansible-playbook -i Ansible-rboshop/inventory.ini Ansible-rboshop/redis.yaml
     - Install Cart, User, Frontend:
       - ansible-playbook -i Ansible-rboshop/inventory.ini Ansible-rboshop/cart.yaml
       - ansible-playbook -i Ansible-rboshop/inventory.ini Ansible-rboshop/user.yaml
       - ansible-playbook -i Ansible-rboshop/inventory.ini Ansible-rboshop/frontend.yaml

3. Deploy / manage systemd services
   - The repository includes example unit files (`*.service`). If a playbook places a unit file under `/etc/systemd/system/`, on the target host run:
     - sudo systemctl daemon-reload
     - sudo systemctl enable <service-name>
     - sudo systemctl start <service-name>
   - Example service names: `cart.service`, `catalogue.service`, `user.service` (verify exact names used by the playbooks).

## Notes and tips
- `mongo.repo` can be placed on target hosts (e.g., under `/etc/yum.repos.d/`) to configure package repository access before installing MongoDB.
- Playbooks expect appropriate connectivity and relevant package manager (yum/apt) behavior on targets. Inspect the individual YAML playbooks to confirm any distribution-specific tasks or variables.
- If a playbook requires application artifacts (binaries, archives, code repo), ensure those artifacts are reachable from target hosts or adjust the playbook to fetch them.

## Troubleshooting
- If a playbook fails, run with increased verbosity to get more details:
  - ansible-playbook -i Ansible-rboshop/inventory.ini Ansible-rboshop/<playbook>.yaml -vvv
- Check target host logs (e.g., systemd journal) for service start failures:
  - sudo journalctl -u <service-name> -xe

## Extending the repo
- Consider adding roles for repeated tasks and extracting variables into group/host vars.
- Add README badges, CI checks, or an example Vagrant/VM setup for testing the playbooks locally.
